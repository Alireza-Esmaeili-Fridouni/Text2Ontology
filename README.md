# Text2Ontology: Knowledge Extraction and Ontology Generation from Text
A tool for converting natural text into ontologies. **Text2Ontology** takes text input and generates a formal ontology representation, enabling structured knowledge extraction from unstructured text.

## Project Overview
The **Text2Ontology** project aims to bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and structured knowledge bases. 
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to automatically identify key concepts, entities, and relationships within text, transforming raw information into a machine-readable ontology.

## Motivation

Ontologies are useful for many downstream tasks (semantic search, knowledge reasoning, data integration). 
However, building them manually is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. 
Text2Ontology aims to partially automate this process: given some text (documents, paragraphs, etc.), generate a domain ontology in OWL (or similar) form that captures concepts, relationships, hierarchies, etc.


## Features

- Parse input text and extract *entities/concepts*.  
- Identify relationships between concepts (e.g. *is-a*, *part-of*, or other domain-specific relations).  
- Use large language models (LLMs) or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to assist where needed.  
- Configurable pipelines (reader → LLM loader → generator → ontology builder).

## Architecture

Here is a rough breakdown of the project modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `reader.py` | Reads and preprocesses text input. |
| `llm_loader.py` | Interfaces with LLMs to generate interim outputs (e.g. candidate relations, definitions). |
| `rag_module.py` | Implements retrieval-augmented generation for providing context, facts, etc. |
| `generator.py` | Builds ontology structure from extracted entities and relations. |
| `onto.py` | Functions for ontology building (e.g. creating classes, properties, saving to file). |
| `util.py` | Utility/helper functions. |
| `config.py` | Configuration parameters (e.g. LLM model, thresholds, file paths). |
| `main.py` | Entry point: ties everything together. |
